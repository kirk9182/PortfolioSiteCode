                Hello,
            </p>
<p>
    I'm REDACTED, a Computer Science major with a specialization in cybersecurity, mathematics, and software development, maintaining a 3.5 GPA at Providence College. As a naturally curious person, my friends say I tend to question almost everything. I’ve always approached problems with skepticism and a drive to explore unconventional solutions. This mindset has led me to pursue innovative, real-world projects that reflect my commitment to impactful work.
</p>
<p>
    My technical experience spans multiple domains, from creating RPG games in Java to projects with Linux, Raspberry Pi, and cybersecurity tools. These self-driven initiatives have honed my skills in Java, Python, C++, and Linux, highlighting my ability to transform ideas into practical applications.
</p>
<p>
    In my recent role as a Security Engineering Intern at Tenable, I designed a web application to streamline customer data management using Google Apps Script, OAuth, and API integrations, supporting the sales team with an efficient interface. Additionally, I started to develop an image verification system as a research project, blending secure data practices with creative media validation solutions. On paper, the official study begins in my spring semester at Providence. 
</p>
<p>
    Previously, as a Threat Intelligence Engineer Intern at ThreatQuotient, I contributed to a major community project by performing threat intelligence report validation, utility maintenance, and onboarding new members. This experience provided me with a deep understanding of the practical aspects of cybersecurity and teamwork in a professional setting.
</p>
<p>
    Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in cloud technologies through independent study for AWS Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate certifications. My involvement with the Digital Asset Association at Providence College keeps me engaged with the latest in cryptocurrency, blockchain, and digital assets. Recently, I completed a research paper on the intersection of philosophy, politics, energy, and cryptocurrency, demonstrating my drive to address complex, interdisciplinary issues.
</p>
<p>
    With a strong foundation in technical skills, practical experience, and a unique approach to problem-solving, I am excited to bring my capabilities, creativity, and dedication to your organization.
</p>
<p>
Best regards,
</p>
<p>
RDACTED

            I recently completed a Security Engineering Internship at Tenable (Summer 2024), where I developed a web application using Google Apps Script, OAuth, and API integrations to streamline customer data management. This project, focused on enhancing post-sale support for the sales team, allowed me to merge technical skills with practical business needs.
